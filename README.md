Using the Unity platform, I developed a 3D platformer game that draws inspiration from the classic Mario Bros, but on a grander scale, presenting a rich, open-world environment. Crafted user interactions and integrating a suite of animations and TextMeshPro to elevate the visual experience. The project is ambitiously aimed at transforming into a fully interactive open-world game, complete with seamless operations and extensive levels.
